/*
Meddler is a small toolkit to take some of the tedium out of moving data
back and forth between sql queries and structs.

It is not a complete ORM. It is intended to be lightweight way to add some
of the convenience of an ORM while leaving more control in the hands of the
programmer.

Package docs are available at:

	http://godoc.org/github.com/russross/meddler

The package is housed on github, and the README there has more info:
